# Cryptographic_Accelerator
Project underway for Harvard's CS2540 (Formal Methods in Computer Security), consisting of the design and functional verification of a TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm) accelerator. After functional verification, the hyperproperty of constant time will be enforced on the accelerator in order to safeguard the encryption against timing-based attacks.
